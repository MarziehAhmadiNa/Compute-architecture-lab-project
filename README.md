# Compute-architecture-lab-project
Image edge detection.
You can change image and also change image name in matlab code (if you want to use matlab code for creating gray scale image of your image) or python code (if you want to use python code for creating gray scale image of your image)
Using aysnc receiver and tarnsmitter is optional. Instead I used 2 rams and give image pixels to first ram coe file.
In this project I used some cores provided by ISE, such as ram and clock divider.
Hardware used: FGPA spartan6, VGA cable, monitor.
Software used: ISE, PlanAhead
